      <p>Fletcher is introduced as a widow in the first episode, her beloved husband Frank having died a couple of years before the start of the series. They had no children – Fletcher says she and Frank "weren't blessed that way" – but did spend some years raising their nephew Grady Fletcher (played by Michael Horton) after the death of his father (an unnamed brother of Frank).
